Breaking down intelligence into components:

1. input / sensors
Some sort of input would be definitely required. 

We could further split this into 
a) the input itself (the raw data emitted by the outer world) 
b) the sensor or input receiver (an organ or component sensitive to a form of input)

2. output / motors
Acting and possibly affecting the outer world.

Two sides to this maybe:
a) internal changes (learning, self-improvement, etc.)
b) external changes (what can be observed from an external point of view)

This implies the existence of a border, a clear separation between the intelligent agent or entity (interior) and it's environment (exterior).

3. memory
This seems to be a requirement for learning. 

We must be able to remember so we can: 
a) analize and improve ourselves
b) avoid past mistakes / repeat past successes

4.will / motivation
Why do anything? 
Why avoid doing anything?

This could be viewed as having values (ethics).
What is good and what is wrong?

Learning can change values.

One metaphor is a state's constitution and laws.
You start with a constitution defining the most important values.
You later create laws which must be aligned with the constitution.
But the constitution can also be changed, although we don't expect this to happen very often.

Can words be separated from their meaning?
That is, can an agent without senses learn a language?
What is a word without a matching sensation?
