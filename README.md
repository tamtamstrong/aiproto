# aiproto

Testing a few ideas on how to build a machine that can learn.
An iterative exploration into how a machine can iteratively explore.

Can we approach this outside - in? 
Can we first discover the big parts or modules and then iteratively define their parts?

What does one need to have in order to be able to learn?
What about learning how to learn? Does one need a language in order to do that?
