Agent should have a distance to the target, called "D" in short.
D should have two dimensions: a vertical (Dv) and a horizontal (Dh) one.
Dv should be equal to 10 units and Dh equal to 8 units. 
Agent should be motivated to have Dv = 0 and Dh = 0.

Agent should have two sensors.
The sensors should be called Sv and Sh.
Sv should measure changes in Dv.
Sh should measure changes in Dh.

Agent should have four motors.
The motors should be called M12, M3, M6 and M9.
When M12 is fired, Dv should have a value lower by 1 unit when measured on the next timer step when fired.
When M6 is fired, Dv should have a value higher by 1 unit when measured on the next timer step when fired.
When M3 is fired, Dh should have a value lower by 1 unit when measured on the next timer step when fired.
When M9 is fired, Dv should have a value higher by 1 unit when measured on the next timer step when fired.
