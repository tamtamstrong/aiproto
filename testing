We would like to apply incremental development.
We do not know the path, we must experiment.

How do we know if we are getting nearer to the goal?
We must test.
The tests must be fast to execute.

What do we test?
Is it the context, the agent, or something else?

Let's explore the different ways of testing.
1. Testing the context
a) We setup the context and the agent.
b) Then we let time flow. 
c) We measure the properties we are interested in.
d) We compare the actual results with the expected ones.

2. Testing the agent
a) We setup the agent
b) We simulate one or more of the modules
c) We check that the tested module behaves as expected

So we either test the agent in a context or we test the components of the agent.
Does the context have components which we could test?

Is the agent part of the context or is it separate?
Or better put, is there an agent? 
We can view the context as the rules of the game and the agent as the player.
But that means defining an interface, putting limits on the agent, defining the agent.
So the context and the agent are one.
