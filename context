The entity or intelligent agent exists or can be tested in a bigger context or world.
From the context's point of view, the agent is a black box.

It is from the context's point of view that we can test the agent.
Does it act / move in any way? 
Does it respond to input? 
How good is the reponse? How intelligent is the entity?

The context also contains the contept of time.
In order to have change there must be passing of time.
Closeness in time of actions is important (correlation).
There must be a before and after. Time must flow in one direction.
