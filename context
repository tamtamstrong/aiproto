The entity or intelligent agent exists or can be tested in a bigger context or world.
From the context's point of view, the agent is a black box.

It is from the context's point of view that we can test the agent.
Does it act / move in any way? 
Does it respond to input? 
How good is the reponse? How intelligent is the entity?

The context also contains the contept of time.
In order to have change there must be passing of time.
Closeness in time of actions is important (correlation).
There must be a before and after. Time must flow in one direction.

Each event must have a timestamp.
Or can it have an index?
When we write an event in a log we create a new entry, we increment a counter and link that counter to the event.
What do we need this index for?
To have an order of events. To be able to group them by closeness in time. 
To be able to link cause and effect.
But then this is for logging purposes only?

What are the smallest parts? The basic construction blocks?
They must have a shape. Some sort of rectangle maybe.
At the minimum they would have two sides of different types (A and B).
Two sides of different type attract each other while sides of the same type repell each other.
So A connects with B and vice-versa but B does not connect with another B nor A with another A.
But then we're talking about space and time (movement).

What are these blocks doing? Just float around?
How many dimensions are there?
Three dimensions are needed i think. And a minimum of two cells for a lego block.
And when two blocks are joined a new one is formed. (it could possibly be split in components later)
So basically we have a lego world with simple 2 cell blocks which can be joined to form larger blocks.
Who joins the blocks? Do they move around randomly until they get in the right position to join?
